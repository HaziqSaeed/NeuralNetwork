# NeuralNetwork

Convolutional neural network (CNN) development includes the process of teaching a
machine through the use of artificial neural networks. CNNs train on a set of sample data for
a period of time, and are tested in their accuracy with separate testing data. The
advancements in neural networks has had a great impact on society, especially in fields
concerning artificial intelligence.
By applying understood concepts surrounding the human brain, engineers have been able to
develop neural networks that can perform certain tasks more efficiently or economically.
Many of these tasks include image recognition, such as telling the difference between
pictures of humans and other animals. The applications of neural networks are endless,
having already been applied in many fields (self-driving cars for example). As society
discovers new information concerning how the human brain function, these new discoveries
could be applied to neural network developments; perhaps neural networks may one day be
able to develop a clearly observable sense of self-awareness, or other animal-like
characteristics.
